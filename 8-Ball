#Magic 8-Ball Program

#This Program will generate a random number and indicate a positive, negative and neutral response

#Imports rand and math functions to use for random generation
import random
import math
#intial value for ask before the while function to avoid infinite loop.
y = "y"
ask = y
#Loops to ask addition questions to avoid having to open program multiple times
#Sets true or false statement for ask = y 
while ask == y:
    name = input("What is your name?")
    question = input("What is your question?")
#Structures response, lower cases all but name. 
    reveal = ((" your answer to " + question + " is"))
    print(name + reveal.lower())
#stops code before reveal
    input("\n\nPress enter now to reveal the answer")
#random number generation
    lucky_number = math.floor(random.random() * 8)
#If statements declaring what response will be given.
